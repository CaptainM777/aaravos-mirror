  Use `?help <command>` for more information on a command. When using `?help <command>`, the `<command>`
  argument should be the *full* command name; command aliases are not accepted.


  If an argument is surrounded with angle brackets (< >), then it is required. If an argument is surrounded 
  with square brackets ([ ]), then it is optional.

      `[the word 'admins' or 'admin']` - An optional argument that makes the new chat session admin-only. Only usable
      by an admin; if it's used by a non-admin, it will create a regular chat session accessible by all staff.
